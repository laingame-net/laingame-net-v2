          This site is trying to reproduce Serial Experiments Lain game in web
          form. The main goal of this site is to provide the ability to play
          SEL game with almost the same experience as the original game. It
          contains all audio and video game files. The main menu is
          represented as a table that is much more convenient then original 3d
          menu. The main file structure replicates the original game as much
          as possible. The only difference is that the all media files are
          unlocked at the start. Translation form Japanese to English is done
          by Serial Experiments Lain PSX Game Translation Project.

        <td>
          On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC released a video game for the
          PlayStation with the same name as the Serial Experiments Lain anime.
          It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki and made to be a "network
          simulator" in which the player would navigate to explore Lain's
          story. The creators themselves did not call it a game, but
          "Psycho-Stretch-Ware", and it has been described as being a kind of
          graphic novel: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of
          information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little
          or no puzzle needed to unlock. Read more on

          The audio and video files are organized in two parts: “Site A” and
          “Site B”, they are represent each of two CD disks of original game.
          Site A contains 22 levels, Site B contains 13 levels. Each level
          contains different numbers of files. Actually, this game has no
          gameplay. The player must check each file one by one from bottom
          levels to the upper and assemble storylines from pieces of
          information. Instead of original game, you can see and open all
          files in any order. However, be careful, you can easily running down
          the one storyline, and falling behind in another storyline. Links on
          unvisited pages is highlighted. You must always check “Depends on”
          links at the file page, if you see yellow links there, you must
          check them out before continue current file.
